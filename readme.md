Installation
1.) Download the repository as a zip file.
2.) Place the zip file where you would like.
3.) Extract the contents of the zip into a folder.

Instructions
1.) Make a folder and name it what you want.
2.) Create folders within that folder named "config" "mods" "resourcepacks" "saves" and "shaderpacks".
3.) Put your mods in the "mods" folder, resourcepacks in the "resourcepacks" folder, etc.
4.) Drag and drop whole profile folder onto the "Create Profile.bat" file and wait for the command prompt to disappear.
5.) Open "Launcher.bat" and pick an option by typing the corresponding number.
	>) {Choose Profile} allows you to choose and load any created profiles.
	>) {Current} shows your currently loaded profile.
	>) {Delete Profile} allows you to delete a created profile (it does not delete it from your minecraft installation).
	>) {exit} exits the Launcher.
	>) {Export Current} exports your currently loaded profile from your minecraft installation to the ProfileLoader folder.
	>) {Save Current} updates you profile from your minecraft installation.
	>) {Start Launcher} starts the minecraft launcher.

Notes
>) This only works with the default minecraft launcher and only if it is installed in the default location on your "C" drive.
>) DO NOT rename folders manually. A lot of the file names are required for the batch files to work the way they do.
>) The uses a couple files from "GnuWin32" CoreUtils. All credit for that goes to them.
